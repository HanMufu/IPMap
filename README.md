# IPMap

This is a Spring Boot application. This project only contains backend codes, please check out frontend [here](https://github.com/HanMufu/IPMap_frontend). 

This project implements:
 - A clear project structure with Controller, Service and DAO
 - RESTful APIs to communicate with client
 - Retrieve data from mongoDB with two optional filters
 - Draw Google Map on the screen and map locations on it
 - Send SMS to user with AWS SNS, check whether phone number is valid
 - Beautiful frontend pages boosted by Vue.js and Element-UI

Other things I did:
 - Deploy mongoDB on AWS EC2
 - Use Postman to test RESTful APIs
 - Use Gradle to maintain dependencies
